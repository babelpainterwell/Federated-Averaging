            An Analysis of [Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks
            from Decentralized Data]
          </h2>
          <p style="text-align: left">
            Federated learning has gained widespread use in healthcare sectors
            where data sharing is often challenging due to concerns over user
            privacy and data ownership. Without adequate techniques to utilize
            these "isolated" data, we typically encounter data silos. Hospitals
            are eager to leverage their data but lack the knowledge to do so
            effectively. Introduced by Google in 2016, federated learning was
            designed to tackle this issue by adhering to the core principle that
            only model gradients or weights, not raw data, are exchanged among
            servers.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left">
            Yet, in recent years, we havenâ€™t seen this technology adopted on a
            large scale, despite increasing societal concern for data privacy
            from both regulatory agencies and the public. One possible reason is
            that tech companies may lack the incentive to allow users to keep
            their data on local devices, as this data is a lucrative resource
            for them. However, I am interested in investigating, from a
            technical standpoint, what factors are impeding the broader adoption
            of this technology.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left">
            The paper "Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from
            Decentralized Data" is seminal in introducing federated learning. It
            outlines the fundamental architecture of an FL system and an
            aggregation algorithm for updating the model on a central server.
            Although this work primarily focuses on optimization properties
            within an FL setting and offers limited discussion on practical
            issues that might arise in real-world applications, I believe it
            provides an excellent foundation for understanding the technology
            and setting the stage for future research or practical applications.
            By the end of this project, I aim to implement this technique
            hands-on and uncover insights into potential solutions for several
            practical challenges.
